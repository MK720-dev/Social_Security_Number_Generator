# Social_Security_Number_Generator

Create a French Social Security Number Generator, and then from that **fake number** create a **fake DataBase**.

### First Step :

Using Official Databases for Fench Regions ('Départements')  and Communes :

- '*code-officiel-geographique-2019-regions-et-departement.csv*'  for the Region Codes and Names.

- '*laposte_hexasmal.csv*' for the Communal Codes and Names.

The data in both files were not ordered and sorted so to make file handling easier I sorted them with '*Combining_DataBases.py*' in an ascending order using the sorting by   selection method.

The sorted files are :

- '*file1_Sorted*' for '*laposte_hexasmal.csv*' .

- '*file2_SSorted*' for '*code-officiel-geographique-2019-regions-et-departement.csv*' .

Then, since it is simpler to work with on database than two distinct one, I used '*Combining_DataBases.py*' to combine the two csv files into one .txt file named 'DataBase' .

### Second Step : Generating the Fakes Social security codes :

The social security (15 nums in total)  number is made of two parts:

- **NIR** : 'Numéro d'inscription au répertoire' (the first 13 nums).

- **Security Key** : Last 2 nums generated by the following algorithm :

> Key = (NIR) % 97

'*Code_Generator.py*' is the code that generates the fake codes based on how they are really made:

> Note that through this code I generated 100 fake number but it can be used to generate way more numbers : it was just a matter of gaining time.

### Third Step:

Interpreting the set of fake numbers one by one and deducing the data of each person : Gender, Birth Year and Month as well as The Region and The Commune of birth.

I assigned each set of data ,corresponding to a  single code, to a fictitious person whose Name and Surname where retrieved from the Official Database of Names and Surnames used in France :

- '*prenom.csv*' for Names.

- '*patronymes.csv*' for Surnames.

The code also generates an email address for each person : 'Surname.Name@gmail.com' .

Each set of data (Gender , Birth Year , Birth Month , Region of Birth, Commune of Birth, Email address , Name ,Surname) were stored in a specific list.

Then they were all zipped in a final list and written to a csv file : '*Social_Sec_DataBase.csv*' .

It is worth noting that the code only assigns names and surnames that occured in the official databases more than 100 times!
