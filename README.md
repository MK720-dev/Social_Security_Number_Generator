# Social_Security_Number_Generator
Generate a French Social Security Number Generator, and then from that fake number create a fake DataBase

-First Step :
  Using Official Databases for Fench Regions ('Départements')  and Communes :
    -'code-officiel-geographique-2019-regions-et-departement.csv'  for the Region Codes and Names
    -'laposte_hexasmal.csv' for the Communal Codes and Names 
   The data in both files were not ordered and sorted so to make file handling easier I sorted them with 'Combining_DataBases.py' in an ascending order using the sorting by   selection method.
   The sorted files are : 
     -'file1_Sorted' for 'laposte_hexasmal.csv'
     -'file2_SSorted' for 'code-officiel-geographique-2019-regions-et-departement.csv'
  Then, since it is simpler to work with on database than two distinct one, I used 'Combining_DataBases.py' to combine the two csv file into one .txt file named 'DataBase'
  
 -Second Step : Generating the Fakes Social security codes
    The social security (15 nums in total)  number is made of two parts:
        NIR : 'Numéro d'inscription au répertoire' (the first 13 nums)
        Security Key : Last 2 nums generated by the following algorithm :
                                  Key = (NIR) % 97
   'Code_Generator.py' is the code that generates the fake codes based on how they are really made: 
        https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F33078#:~:text=Sexe%20(1er%20chiffre),commune%20officiel%20de%20l'%20Insee%20)
     
   Note that through this code I generated 100 fake number but it can be used to generate way more numbers : it was just a matter of gaining time.
 
 -Third Step: 
    Interpreting the set of fake numbers one by one and deducing the data of each person : Gender, Birth Year and Month as well as The Region and The Commune of birth
    I assigned each set of data ,corresponding to a  single code, to a fictitious person whose Name and Surname where retrieved from the Official Database of Names and Surnames used in France :
      -'prenom.csv' for Names
      -'patronymes.csv' for Surnames 
    The code also generates an email address for each person : 'Surname.Name@gmail.com' 
    Each set of data (Gender , Birth Year , Birth Month , Region of Birth, Commune of Birth, Email address , Name ,Surname) were stored in a specific list.
    Then they were all zipped in a final list and written to a csv file : 'Social_Sec_DataBase.csv'
     
   It is worth noting that the code only assigns names and surnames that occured in the official databases more than 100 times !
